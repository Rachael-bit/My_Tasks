# Task1- Explain each output of the program below.
# Give 3 usecases or cenarios where you can apply the program below.
# # Write the code for 1 of the 3 use cases.

num1 = int(input("Enter first number;")) 
num2  = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"{num1} == {num2} : {num1 == num2}")
#The above depicts equality to show if num1 is equal to num2.

print(f"{num1} != {num2} : {num1 != num2}")
#The above depicts inequality; showing if num1 is equal to num2.

print(f"{num1} > {num2} : {num1 > num2}")
# The above generated an output showing if num1 is equal to num2

print(f"{num1} < {num2} : {num1 < num2}")
# The above generated an output showing if num1 is unequal to num2

#Use cases where the above can program can be applied:
#Scenario 1: Camparison between total numbers of male vs female in a classroom

#Scenario 2: Comparison between the total number of laity versus clergy in the Arch-diocese.

# Scenario 3 : Comparison  between the number of animate vs inanimate things.

male = int(input("Enter the number of male students: ")) 
female  = int(input("Enter the number of female students:  "))
print(f"{male} == {female} : {male == female}")
